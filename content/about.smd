## Why Audio Quality Matters

Remote work is here to stay. But not everyone has the same setup. Some people work from quiet home offices with studio-quality microphones. Others dial in from noisy cafes on laptop speakers. This disparity creates a communication equity problem: people with poor audio quality may be perceived as less competent, even when they're not.

This project started with a simple question: **Can we quantify the business impact of audio quality?**

## Understanding MOS (Mean Opinion Score)

The telecommunications industry has a standard metric for speech quality: the Mean Opinion Score (MOS), defined by ITU-T Recommendation P.800. It's a 1-5 scale based on human listening tests:

| MOS | Quality | What It Means |
|-----|---------|---------------|
| 5.0 | Excellent | Imperceptible degradation—sounds perfect |
| 4.0 | Good | Perceptible but not annoying |
| 3.0 | Fair | Slightly annoying—requires more focus |
| 2.0 | Poor | Annoying—hard to follow |
| 1.0 | Bad | Very annoying—communication breaks down |

Most VoIP calls land somewhere between 3.0 and 4.5. The difference between a 3.0 and a 4.0 might seem small, but it represents a meaningful shift in communication clarity.

## Research Questions

This project explores three interconnected questions:

### 1. How do speech quality indicators change with degradation?

When audio is compressed, bandwidth-limited, or corrupted by noise, how do measurable features like vocal shimmer, harmonic-to-noise ratio, and spectral characteristics change? Understanding these relationships is the foundation for prediction.

### 2. Can acoustic features predict perceived quality?

Given a set of audio features extracted from a sample, can we predict what MOS score a human listener would assign? This is the core machine learning challenge.

### 3. What's the ROI of improving audio quality?

If an organization can improve average call quality from MOS 3.0 to 4.0, what's the dollar value of that improvement? This translates technical metrics into business decisions.

## Why This Matters

### Communication Equity

Poor audio quality disproportionately affects:
- Remote workers in shared living spaces
- Employees without budget for quality equipment
- International participants dealing with bandwidth constraints
- People whose first language differs from the meeting's primary language

When someone's audio is choppy or noisy, listeners may unconsciously attribute the difficulty to the speaker rather than the technology.

### The Remote Work Reality

According to research cited by Microsoft's Work Trend Index, poor audio quality in meetings leads to:
- Increased cognitive load (you work harder to understand)
- More frequent misunderstandings
- Reduced engagement and participation
- Meeting fatigue accumulating faster

These effects compound. A single bad-audio meeting might be forgettable, but experiencing them daily affects productivity and wellbeing.

### Quantifiable Business Impact

This project connects technical quality metrics to business outcomes:
- **Meeting effectiveness**: What percentage of meeting time is productive?
- **Misunderstanding probability**: How often do people mishear or miscommunicate?
- **Annual cost per employee**: What's the dollar value of lost productivity?

By making these connections explicit, organizations can make informed decisions about investing in audio quality improvements.
