## From MOS to Dollars

A MOS score of 3.2 vs 4.0 might seem abstract. But when you translate it into meeting effectiveness, misunderstanding probability, and annual cost, it becomes concrete.

The `BusinessMetricsCalculator` converts MOS into actionable metrics:

```python
from speech_quality.business.metrics import BusinessMetricsCalculator

calc = BusinessMetricsCalculator()

# Compare two quality levels
mos_poor = 3.0
mos_good = 4.0

metrics_poor = calc.calculate_all_metrics(mos_score=mos_poor)
metrics_good = calc.calculate_all_metrics(mos_score=mos_good)

print(f"MOS {mos_poor} → {mos_good} improvement:")
print(f"  Meeting effectiveness: {metrics_poor['effective_meeting_time_pct']:.0f}% → {metrics_good['effective_meeting_time_pct']:.0f}%")
print(f"  Misunderstanding prob: {metrics_poor['misunderstanding_probability']*100:.0f}% → {metrics_good['misunderstanding_probability']*100:.0f}%")
print(f"  Annual cost savings: ${metrics_poor['annual_cost_per_employee'] - metrics_good['annual_cost_per_employee']:,.0f}/employee")
```

## Business Metrics Explained

### Communication Clarity Index (CCI)

A 0-100 score that combines MOS with additional penalties for poor quality:

```python
def calculate_communication_clarity_index(self, mos_score: float) -> float:
    """CCI: 0-100 score for communication quality."""
    # Linear scale from MOS
    cci = ((mos_score - 1.0) / 4.0) * 100.0

    # Non-linear penalty for poor quality
    if mos_score < 3.0:
        penalty = (3.0 - mos_score) * 10
        cci = max(0, cci - penalty)

    return cci
```

| MOS | CCI | Interpretation |
|-----|-----|----------------|
| 4.5 | 87.5 | Excellent - minimal effort to understand |
| 4.0 | 75.0 | Good - occasional clarification needed |
| 3.5 | 62.5 | Fair - noticeable effort required |
| 3.0 | 50.0 | Poor - frequent miscommunication |
| 2.5 | 32.5 | Bad - communication breakdown |

### Meeting Effectiveness

What percentage of meeting time is actually productive?

```python
def calculate_meeting_effectiveness(self, mos_score: float, duration_minutes: float = 60) -> float:
    """Effective meeting time percentage (0-100)."""
    base_effectiveness = 0.85  # Even perfect meetings have some inefficiency

    # Audio quality factor: perfect(1.0) to poor(0.4)
    audio_quality_factor = self._interpolate_mos_factor(mos_score, {
        "mos_1": 0.4,
        "mos_2": 0.6,
        "mos_3": 0.8,
        "mos_4": 0.95,
        "mos_5": 1.0,
    })

    # Fatigue increases with duration
    if duration_minutes <= 30:
        fatigue_factor = 1.0
    elif duration_minutes <= 60:
        fatigue_factor = 0.95
    else:
        fatigue_factor = 0.85

    return base_effectiveness * audio_quality_factor * fatigue_factor * 100
```

### Misunderstanding Probability

Based on research mapping MOS to communication errors:

| MOS | Misunderstanding Probability |
|-----|------------------------------|
| 4.5+ | 5% |
| 4.0 | 10% |
| 3.5 | 20% |
| 3.0 | 30% |
| 2.5 | 45% |
| 2.0 | 60% |
| <2.0 | 80% |

### Annual Cost Per Employee

The formula:

```python
def calculate_costs(self, mos_score: float, hourly_rate: float = 65.0, meeting_hours_per_week: float = 12.0):
    """Calculate annual productivity cost from poor audio."""

    # How much meeting time is wasted?
    meeting_effectiveness_pct = self.calculate_meeting_effectiveness(mos_score)
    meeting_effectiveness = meeting_effectiveness_pct / 100.0

    # Productivity loss per meeting hour
    productivity_loss_per_hour = hourly_rate * (1 - meeting_effectiveness)

    # Annual calculation
    working_weeks_per_year = 48
    remote_meeting_percentage = 0.70  # 70% of meetings are remote
    weekly_remote_hours = meeting_hours_per_week * remote_meeting_percentage

    annual_cost = weekly_remote_hours * working_weeks_per_year * productivity_loss_per_hour

    return {"annual_cost_per_employee": annual_cost, ...}
```

## The Numbers

Using default assumptions ($65/hour, 12 meeting hours/week, 70% remote):

| MOS | CCI | Meeting Effectiveness | Annual Cost |
|-----|-----|----------------------|-------------|
| 2.0 | 15 | 41% | $2,924 |
| 2.5 | 33 | 53% | $2,335 |
| 3.0 | 50 | 65% | $1,747 |
| 3.5 | 63 | 73% | $1,354 |
| 4.0 | 75 | 81% | $962 |
| 4.5 | 88 | 89% | $569 |

### Improvement ROI

Improving from MOS 3.0 to MOS 4.0:

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Meeting Effectiveness | 65% | 81% | +16 percentage points |
| Misunderstanding Prob | 30% | 10% | -20 percentage points |
| Annual Cost | $1,747 | $962 | **$785 savings** |

For a 500-employee organization: **$392,500 annual savings**

## Cognitive Load

Poor audio doesn't just waste time—it exhausts people:

```python
def calculate_cognitive_load_index(self, mos_score: float) -> float:
    """Cognitive load index (0-100)."""
    base_load = 20.0  # Normal conversation effort

    # Additional load from poor audio
    if mos_score >= 4.5:
        additional_load = 0
    elif mos_score >= 4.0:
        additional_load = 10
    elif mos_score >= 3.0:
        additional_load = 30
    elif mos_score >= 2.0:
        additional_load = 50
    else:
        additional_load = 70

    return min(100.0, base_load + additional_load)
```

At MOS 3.0, cognitive load is 50/100. At MOS 4.0, it's 30/100. That difference accumulates across hours of meetings.

## Conclusions

### What I Learned

1. **Voice quality features matter most**. Shimmer and jitter—prosodic features from Praat—are more predictive than spectral features from librosa.

2. **The model works, but isn't perfect**. R² of 0.54 means there's still unexplained variance, likely from subjective human factors.

3. **Small MOS changes have real costs**. A 1-point MOS improvement can save hundreds of dollars per employee annually.

4. **Data sourcing is hard**. Finding and preparing audio quality datasets was the biggest time investment.

### Implications

For organizations:
- **Audit audio quality**. Sample recordings to understand current MOS levels.
- **Invest in equipment**. Quality headsets and microphones pay for themselves quickly.
- **Optimize network**. QoS settings for VoIP traffic can prevent degradation.

For individuals:
- **Environment matters**. A quiet room improves quality more than expensive gear.
- **Check your setup**. Test audio before important calls.
- **Be aware of impact**. Poor audio affects how others perceive you.

### Future Work

1. **Real-time prediction**: Deploy the model as a service that monitors call quality live
2. **Personalized thresholds**: Different people may tolerate different quality levels
3. **Causality analysis**: Which specific degradations hurt most in which contexts?
4. **Integration with communication platforms**: Feedback loops for continuous improvement
